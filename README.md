- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dana-Vogon
- I'm officiously bureaucratic
- I work for the Galatic Bureau of Government Efficiency on Vogsphere
- I like poetry. Here is a snippet of our beloved Vogon poetry by uncle Jeltz.
- Please cover your ears or they'll bleed: 
- Oh freddled gruntbuggly, Thy micturations are to me
- As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.
- Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes,
- And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,
- or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!
