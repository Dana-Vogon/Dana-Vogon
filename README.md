- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dana-Vogon
- I'm officiously bureaucratic
- I work for the Galatic Bureau of Government Efficiency on Vogsphere
- I like poetry. Here is a snippet of our beloved Vogon poetry by uncle Jeltz.
- Please cover your ears or they'll bleed: 
“Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturitions are to me,
As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
On a lurgid bee,
That mordiously hath blurted out,
Its earted jurtles,
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer.
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
And living glupules frart and slipulate,
Like jowling meated liverslime,
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turling dromes,
And hooptiously drangle me,
With crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
See if I don't.”
